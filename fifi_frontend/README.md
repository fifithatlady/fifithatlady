# Fifi's React App Quick Start Guide

Welcome to Fifi's React App! This project was initiated using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), providing you with a streamlined development setup.

## Available Commands

Navigate to your project directory and run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Launches the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload when you make changes.\
Check the console for any lint errors.

### `npm test`

Initiates the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
Refer to the [testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more details.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.\
It optimizes the build for the best performance, including minification and hash-named files.

Your app is now ready for deployment!

Learn more about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for additional information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, there's no turning back!**

If you're dissatisfied with the build tools and configurations, you can `eject` at any time. This action removes the single build dependency but grants you full control over the configuration files and dependencies.

You can continue using other commands without `eject`, but they will now reference the copied scripts. The choice is yours.

Remember, `eject` is not mandatory. The default features suit small to medium deployments. Customize it when you're ready.
